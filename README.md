Problems:
1. How to position the notification bar so that the "About" section is not covered constantly?

2. Is it possible to make "radio" options for time slots for the visit required?
   I've added multiple options and would like the visitor to choose one before
   submitting the form so that there is no risk of submitting it empty.
